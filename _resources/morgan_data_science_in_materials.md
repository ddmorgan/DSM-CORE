## Type of Content
* Full Course
* Slides, Jupyter Notebooks
* This course is in modules. The key information of what is in each module can be found in /Admin/Module Tasks HW List_v2 (links may need to be updated).  Each module has a folder for HW, slides, and labs in /Modules. There were quizzes but those are in Canvas so I cannot share them easily.  Fee free to email me for more details.  Easy use cases are to grab a whole module for your class, or grab a one or more of a notebook or slides from a modules to help in prep for a topic. All Notebooks should run on Google CoLab and have problems at the end.  Email me for solutions.
* Module topics summary (see /Admin/Module Tasks HW List_v2 for more information)
